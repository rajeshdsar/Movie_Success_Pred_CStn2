# Movie Success Prediction
### Capstone 2: Predict Movie Success / Box office
***
_This is my second Capstone project for my Springboard Data Science Career track. This is a prediction problem to predict the financial success of a movie based on factors that go in to making a movie._

The objective of this project will be to predict commercial success of a movie. Movies have been one of the entertainment industries that sees huge sums of money being invested. Though making movies are art than science, this project tries to explore if there are any formulas or secret recipe in making commercially successful movies. This project will also try to explore the important parameters or factors that influence the success of a movie.

This project has two iPython notebooks, and this is the second notebook. The first notebook is `Predict_Movie_Box_Office_Capstone_2_Data_Collection`. The first one is this where the data is obtained from different sources and put together for the next steps in building the model. The second notebook `Predict_move_box_off_data_viz_and_model` uses the data collected in this notebook to visualize the data and build suitable prediction models.
